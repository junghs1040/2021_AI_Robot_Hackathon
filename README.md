## 1. Project Introduction
Serving robots that are currently applied to most restaurants are half-automatic.

When serving, the robot brings the bowl to the side of the table, but the customer has to move the bowl to the table by himself.

The biggest problem is that you absolutely need staff to pick up the bowls.

So, restaurant operators who currently use serving robots on the market require additional staff even if they have robots.
